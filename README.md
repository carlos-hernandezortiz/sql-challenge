# sql-challenge
Challenge on SQL.

In this folder, you will be able to find the challenge on SQL. You will be able to find the .sql file, named 'table_creation' which has the commands to create 
the tables used for the exercise. The tables were then populated with a csv file. Then, on the 'employees fetch' file, you will find the homework's solution. Last,
but not least, you will find the bonus exercise, which consists of the connection of the Jupyter Notebook with PostgreSQL, and some queries made and also data 
viz using Matplotlib.
